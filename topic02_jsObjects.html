    <h1>Topic02: JavaScript Objects</h1><br>
    <h3>Object Literal</h3>
    <p>I have created two objects called employee_1 and employee_2. Please<br>
    enter either the number 1 or 2 to view a few of the object properties.</p>
    <input type="text" id="user_input">
    <button type="button" onclick="createObject()">View Employee Info</button>
    <div id="display_1"></div><br>

    <h3>Add Properties to an Exsisting Object</h3>
    <p>We will use the employee_1 object created above and add a property<br>
    to our object. No need to re-code the literal, just add a property<br>
    by declaring our objectName.property and set it equal to the data we <br>
    wish to insert into that property. We will add a hireDate property to <br>
    employee_1. <br><br>
    <button type="button" onclick="addProperty()">Show New Property</button>
    <div id="display_2"></div><br>

    <h3>Object.create()</h3>
    <p>We will use this method to create an object from an already exsisting<br>
    object. We will take employee_2 and use it as a prototype to create employee_3.<br>
    From there we can edit the properties, but the properties that we do not change<br>
    will remain the same as the properties from employee_2.</p><br>
    <button type="button" onclick="objectCreate()">View Employee_3 Info</button><br>
    <div id="display_3"></div>

    <h3>This Method</h3>
    <p>We have created a function as part of the employee_1 object that will<br>
    display a list of all the information we have about employee_1. We use the<br>
    'this' keyword to refer to the employee_1 object and call it's properties.</p><br>
    <button type="button" onclick="displayEmployeeInfo()">Show Employee_1 Full Profile</button>
    <div id="display_4"></div><br>
